“E
CHAPTER ELEVEN
lwood?”
He grunted in response from the living room,
where the  window kept  a  sliver of  Broadway
below: Sammy’s  Shoe Repair,  the  closed-down travel agency,  and  the
median that ran up the avenue. The angle of his vision made a trapezoid, his
personal snow globe of the city. It was a good place to smoke and he’d
found a way to perch on the sill that didn’t aggravate his back.
“I’m going out for a bag of ice, I can’t take it anymore,” Denise said,
and locked the front door behind her. He had given her a set of keys last
week.
He  didn’t  mind  the  heat. This  city  knew how  to  concoct a  miserable
summer, sure, but it had nothing on the South on those hot days. The way
New Yorkers complained about summer heat, on the subway, in the bodega,
made him snicker ever since he got here. There was a garbage strike then,
too, his first day in the city, but it had been February. It didn’t smell as bad.
This time whenever he  left  the  vestibule downstairs, the  stench was  a
thicket—he wanted a machete to hack through it. It was only the second
day of the strike.
The wildcat strike of ’68: an introduction to the city so wretched that he
had  to  interpret it  as  a  hazing. Steel trash cans  mobbed the  pavement—
overflowing and untouched for days—and the newer garbage in bundled
bags and  cardboard boxes huddled against them. He  avoided public
transportation in a new place until he got the lay of it and he’d never been
on a subway before. He walked all the way uptown from the Port Authority.
Walking in a straight line was impossible. He weaved around the mounds of
refuse. When he  got  to  the  Statler,  the SRO  on  Ninety-Ninth Street, the
residents had kicked open a path to the front door between two monstrous

piles of garbage. Rats zipped back and forth. If you wanted to break into
one of the second-floor rooms, all you had to do was scale the trash.
The manager gave him a key to a place in the back, four flights up. Hot
plate, with a bathroom down the hall. One of the guys he worked with in
Baltimore told  him  about the  flophouse and  painted a  terrible picture. It
wasn’t as bad as the guy made it out. He’d stayed in worse places. After a
couple of days, he bought cleanser at the A&P and took it on himself to
clean the toilet and shower. No one else bothered—that kind of joint. He’d
scrubbed dirty johns plenty of times, plenty of places.
On his knees in the stink. Welcome to New York.
Down on Broadway, Denise crossed his perch view. Seen from street
level, the median was clean most days. From the third floor you peered over
the benches and trees and saw the trash crowding the subway ventilation
grates and paving stones. Paper bags and beer bottles and tabloids. Now the
crap was everywhere, in drifts. With the latest strike under way, everybody
saw what he saw all the time: The city was a mess.
He stubbed out his smoke in the teacup and made it to the couch without
hitting one of those gongs. Ever since he put his back out, he’d feel all right
and  forget  and  move too  fast  and  then gong—a  detonation in  his  spine.
Gong while sitting on the toilet, gong while picking up his pants. He yelped
like a dog and then curled on the floor for a few minutes. The bathroom tile
cool on his skin. It was his own fault. You never knew what was in those
drawers and boxes. One time when they were moving this old Ukrainian
guy—a cop who got his pension and picked up stakes to Philadelphia where
he had a niece—he bent down to lift a night table and his spine popped.
Larry said he heard it from the hallway. The cop kept his free weights in
there. Three hundred pounds of weights, in case he got the urge to lift in the
middle of the night. What put his back out last week was a big wooden
bureau, harmless-looking, but  he’d  been working extra shifts for  money.
Sleepy and  sloppy.  “You  got  to  watch it  with  that  Danish modern shit,”
Larry told him. When Denise returned he’d ask her to fill another hot-water
bottle, long  as  she  was  going to  be  in  the  kitchen fixing more rum  and
Cokes.
The block was loud most nights with salsa music and it was louder this
evening, what with everyone keeping their windows open because of the

heat, plus tomorrow was July Fourth. Everyone had off. If his back wasn’t
too troublesome, they were going to Coney Island for the fireworks, but
tonight they  would stay  in  and  watch The  Defiant Ones  on  channel  4.
Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis, two convicts chained together on the run
through the swamp, dodging hunting dogs and dumb-faced deputies with
shotguns. Phony Hollywood crap, but he always watched the movie when it
came on, usually on The Late Late Show, and Denise liked Sidney Poitier.
His rooms were furnished with castoffs from work. A kind of showroom
for the furniture of New Yorkers from all over the city, in rotation, new stuff
coming in  and  old  stuff  going out.  His  queen-size bed  with  the  type  of
super-stiff mattress he liked, the dresser with the fancy brass studs, all the
lamps and  rugs. People get  rid  of  plenty when they  move—sometimes
they’re changing not  just  places but  personalities. Up  or  down “the
economic ladder.” Maybe the bed won’t fit in the new place, or the sofa’s
too  boxy,  or  they’re newlyweds  and  put  a  new  living-room set  on  their
registry. A lot of these white-flight families splitting for the suburbs, Long
Island and Westchester, they’re making a whole new start—shaking the city
off, and that means getting rid of how they used to see themselves. Him and
the rest of the crew from Horizon Moving had dibs before the junkman got
his hands on it. The couch he lay on now was his twelfth in seven years.
Constantly upgrading. One of the perks of working for a moving company,
though it was hell on your back sometimes.
Even if he scavenged furniture like a transient, he put down roots. After
his childhood home, this was the place he’d lived the longest. He started
this New York stint at the SRO, stayed there a few months until he got the
job  at  4  Brothers  washing dishes. He  moved around a  bunch—uptown,
Spanish Harlem—until he got a line on the job at Horizon, steady work, and
humped it down here to Eighty-Second Street off Broadway. He knew he
was going to take the apartment when the landlord threw the door wide:
here. Four years and counting. “I’m middle class now,” he joked to himself.
Even the roaches were of a noble sort, scurrying when he turned on the
bathroom light instead of ignoring his presence. He took their modesty as a
touch of class.
Denise returned. “Did you hear me outside?” She went into the kitchen
and stabbed the bag of ice with a butter knife.

“What?”
“This rat ran across my feet and I screamed. That was me,” she said.
Denise was tall and Harlem-tough and could’ve played basketball in one
of the lady leagues. One of these city girls who wasn’t afraid of anything.
He’d seen her  curse out  this  muscle-bound turkey who whispered
something untoward as she passed on the street, she got up in the dude’s
face, but a rat made her squeal like a little girl. Denise was most definitely
not a little girl, so when she let out that part of her it was always a surprise.
She lived on 126th next to a vacant lot and the heat and now the garbage
made the  empty lot  livelier than  usual. The  bastards were everywhere,
bursting out of their underground hidey-holes. She said she saw a rat as big
as a dog last night. “Barked like one, too.” He opined that maybe it was a
dog, but she wasn’t going back today and he was glad to have her.
Her Wednesday-night classes were canceled because of the Fourth. He
was off, too, that afternoon, sleeping when she came over and got into bed
with  him. Her  big  silver earrings  on  the  bedside table—courtesy of  the
Atkinson family, Turtle Bay to York Avenue, three kids and a dog and a
Gimbels dining-room set—woke him up. By now she knew the spot on his
back where it hurt and kneaded it and then told him to roll over and got on
top. The room was ten degrees hotter when they were done and well tangled
up in each other. Warm rum and Cokes worked for a while and then they
didn’t and an ice run was in order.
They met at the high school up on 131st Street. At night there were adult
classes. He was working on his GED and she taught ESL to Dominicans and
Poles in the classroom next door. He waited to finish the course before he
asked her out. Earned his certificate and feeling proud and it was one of
those moments that makes you realize you have no one in your life who
cares about the occasional triumph. He’d had the thought of getting his GED
in the back of his mind for a while. Tended to it like it was a candle flame
cupped in his hand out of the wind. He kept seeing the ads on the subway—
Complete Your Studies at Night on Your Own Terms—and was so happy to
get that piece of paper that he said, Fuck it, and walked right up to her. Big
brown eyes and a bridge of freckles over her nose. On His Own Terms. He
hardly ever did it any other way.

Asked her out and she said no. She was seeing someone. Then a month
later she called him up and they went out for Cuban Chinese.
Denise brought over the rum and Cokes with ice. “And I got us some
sandwiches,” she said.
He set up the TV tray, which had been left behind by Mr. Waters when
he  picked up  stakes from Amsterdam Avenue to  Arthur Avenue in  the
Bronx. It folded up so that it fit neat between the couch and the end table,
like that. Nobel Prize in Physics to the guy who invented it.
“They need to get off their asses and pick it all up,” Denise said from the
kitchen. “Beame has to pick up the phone and talk to these people.”
She  thought the  mayor was  a  bum and  relished the  strike for  its
opportunity of complaint. She listed her gripes as he wrangled the rabbit
ears to the best place for channel 4. The smell, she said, for one—of the
rotting food and the bleach the supers sprayed on top of it. The bleach was
for the flies that swarmed over the piles of trash in a gross haze and for the
maggots twisting on the pavement. Then there was the smoke. People lit the
garbage on fire to get rid of it—he didn’t understand this, and he considered
himself a student of the human animal—and the limp breezes between the
buildings carried the  smoke all  over.  The  fire  engines screamed  as  they
scattered across the city on the avenues and side streets.
That, plus the rats.
He sighed. In every argument he took whatever side stuck it to the Man,
rule one. Cops and politicians, fat-cat businessmen and judges, the assorted
motherfuckers working levers. “They got  ’em  by  the  balls, they  should
twist,” he  said. “They’re working men.” Mayor Beame, Nixon and  his
bullshit, it was almost enough to make him want to vote. But he avoided the
government whenever possible so as not to push his little bit of luck.
“Why don’t you sit down, baby,” he said. “I’ll get it together.”
“I already did it all.” Even put the kettle on for his hot-water bottle. It
whistled.
Trash-fire smoke snuck in through the window so he opened the one in
the bedroom for cross ventilation. She was right. It’d be a true hassle if this
strike went as long as the last one. It was terrible out there. But it was good
for the rest of the city to see what kind of place they were really living in.

Try his perspective for a change. See how they liked it.
The news anchor offered the holiday weather and gave a brief update on
the  strike—“talks continue”—and told  the  viewers to  stay  tuned for  the
Nine O’Clock Movie.
He tapped her glass with his. “You’re married to me, now—here’s the
ring.”
“What?”
“From the movie. Sidney Poitier says it.” Holding up the chains that
bind him to the redneck.
“You should watch what you say.”
Sure, the dialogue changed depending on who was saying it and who
you  said  it  to.  Like the  ending of  the  movie. On  the  one  hand,  neither
convict made it  out.  Or  you  look  at  it  the  other way  and  each  of  them
could’ve made it to freedom if they’d let the other one die. Maybe it didn’t
matter—they were fucked either way. He stopped watching the movie a few
years later when he realized he didn’t watch it because it was sort of corny,
or they got the facts wrong, or it marked how far he had come, but because
watching it made him sad, and a nutjob part of him sought out that sadness.
At a certain point he learned the smarter play was to avoid the things that
brought you low.
That night, though, he didn’t see the end of the movie because Denise
wore a denim skirt and her big thighs sticking out distracted him too much.
He reached over when that antacid commercial came on.
The  Defiant Ones,  then sex,  then sleep. Fire  engines in  the  night.
Tomorrow morning he had to get up and out, back pain or no, because at ten
he was going to meet the man and buy the van. He had a roll of bills tucked
in his boot under his bed and he’d miss the satisfaction of adding twenty
bucks to it on payday. Tore down the flier in the laundromat so no one else
could beat him to it: a ’67 Ford Econoline. Needed a new finish, glossy, but
the guys on 125th owed him one. And then he’d supplement his Horizon
shifts with his own jobs. Weekends, too, bring on Larry so he can pay off
his old lady. You couldn’t count on the Department of Sanitation, but Larry
bellyaching about his child support was as dependable as U.S. Steel.

He decided to call his company Ace Moving. AAA was taken and he
wanted to be at the top of the phone book. It was six months before he
realized he picked the name from his time at Nickel. Ace: out in the free
world to make your zigzag way.
