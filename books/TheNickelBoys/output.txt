CHAPTER ONE
lwood received the best gift of his life on Christmas
Day 1962, even if the ideas it put in his head were
his undoing. Martin Luther King at Zion Hill was
the only album he owned and it never left the turntable. His grandmother
Harriet had a few gospel records, which she only played when the world
discovered a new mean way to work on her, and Elwood wasn’t allowed to
listen to the Motown groups or popular songs like that on account of their
licentious nature. The rest of his presents that year were clothes—a new red
sweater, socks—and he certainly wore those out, but nothing endured such
good and constant use as the record. Every scratch and pop it gathered over
the months was a mark of his enlightenment, tracking each time he entered
into a new understanding of the reverend’s words. The crackle of truth.
They didn’t have a TV set but Dr. King’s speeches were such a vivid
chronicle—containing all that the Negro had been and all that he would be
—that the  record was  almost as  good as  television. Maybe even better,
grander, like the towering screen at the Davis Drive-In, which he’d been to
twice. Elwood saw it all: Africans persecuted by the white sin of slavery,
Negroes humiliated and kept low by segregation, and that luminous image
to come, when all those places closed to his race were opened.
The  speeches had  been recorded  all  over,  Detroit and  Charlotte  and
Montgomery, connecting Elwood to the rights struggle across the country.
One speech even made him feel like a member of the King family. Every
kid had heard of Fun Town, been there or envied someone who had. In the
third cut on side A, Dr. King spoke of how his daughter longed to visit the
amusement park on Stewart Avenue in Atlanta. Yolanda begged her parents
whenever she spotted the big sign from the expressway or the commercials
came on  TV.  Dr.  King had  to  tell  her  in  his  low,  sad  rumble about the

segregation system that kept colored boys and girls on the other side of the
fence. Explain the misguided thinking of some whites—not all whites, but
enough whites—that gave it force and meaning. He counseled his daughter
to resist the lure of hatred and bitterness and assured her that “Even though
you can’t go to Fun Town, I want you to know that you are as good as
anybody who goes into Fun Town.”
That was Elwood—as good as anyone. Two hundred and thirty miles
south of Atlanta, in Tallahassee. Sometimes he saw a Fun Town commercial
while visiting his  cousins in  Georgia.  Lurching rides and  happy music,
chipper white kids  lining up  for  the  Wild  Mouse Roller Coaster,  Dick’s
Mini Golf. Strap into the Atomic Rocket for a trip to the moon. A perfect
report card guaranteed free admission, the commercials said, if your teacher
stamped a red mark on it. Elwood got all A’s and kept his stack of evidence
for  the  day  they  opened Fun  Town  to  all  God’s  children, as  Dr.  King
promised. “I’ll  get  in  free  every day  for  a  month, easy,”  he  told  his
grandmother, lying on the front-room rug and tracing a threadbare patch
with his thumb.
His grandmother Harriet had rescued the rug from the alley behind the
Richmond Hotel after the last renovation. The bureau in her room, the tiny
table next to Elwood’s bed, and three lamps were also Richmond castoffs.
Harriet had worked at the hotel since she was fourteen, when she had joined
her  mother  on  the  cleaning staff.  Once Elwood entered high  school, the
hotel manager Mr. Parker made it clear he’d hire him as a porter whenever
he wanted, smart kid like him, and the white man was disappointed when
the  boy  began working at  Marconi’s  Tobacco &  Cigars. Mr.  Parker was
always kind to the family, even after he had to fire Elwood’s mother for
stealing.
Elwood liked the Richmond and he liked Mr. Parker, but adding a fourth
generation to  the  hotel’s  accounts  made him  uneasy in  a  way  he  found
difficult to describe. Even before the encyclopedias. When he was younger,
he sat on a crate in the hotel kitchen after school, reading comic books and
Hardy Boys while his  grandmother straightened and  scrubbed upstairs.
With  both his  parents gone, she  preferred to  have her  nine-year-old
grandson nearby instead of  alone in  the  house. Seeing Elwood  with  the
kitchen men made her think those afternoons were a kind of school in their

own  right, that  it  was  good for  him  to  be  around men. The  cooks and
waiters took  the  boy  for  a  mascot, playing hide-and-seek with  him  and
peddling creaky wisdom on various topics: the white man’s ways, how to
treat a good-time gal, strategies for hiding money around the house. Elwood
didn’t understand what the older men talked about most of the time, but he
nodded gamely before returning to his adventure stories.
After rushes, Elwood sometimes challenged the dishwashers to plate-
drying races and they made a good-natured show of being disappointed by
his superior skills. They liked seeing his smile and his odd delight at each
win. Then the  staff  turned over.  The  new downtown hotels poached
personnel, cooks came and went, a few of the waiters didn’t return after the
kitchen reopened from flood damage. With the change in staff, Elwood’s
races changed from endearing novelty to  mean-spirited hustle;  the  latest
dishwashers were tipped off that the grandson of one of the cleaning girls
did your work for you if you told him it was a game, keep on the lookout.
Who was this serious boy who loitered around while the rest of them busted
their asses, getting little pats on the head from Mr. Parker like he was a
damn puppy, nose in a comic book like he hadn’t a care? The new men in
the kitchen had different kinds of lessons to impart to a young mind. Stuff
they’d learned about the world. Elwood remained unaware that the premise
of the competition had changed. When he issued a challenge, everybody in
the kitchen tried not to smirk.
Elwood was  twelve when the  encyclopedias appeared. One  of  the
busboys dragged a stack of boxes into the kitchen and called for a powwow.
Elwood squeezed  in—it was  a  set  of  encyclopedias that  a  traveling
salesman had left behind in one of the rooms upstairs. There were legends
about the valuables that rich white people left in their rooms, but it was rare
that this kind of plunder made it down to their domain. Barney the cook
opened the  top  box  and  held  up  the  leather-bound volume of Fisher’s
Universal Encyclopedia, Aa–Be.  He  handed it  to  Elwood, who  was
surprised at how heavy it was, a brick with pages edged in red. The boy
flipped through,  squinting at  the  tiny words—Aegean, Archimedes,
Argonaut—and had a picture of himself on the front-room couch copying
words he liked. Words that looked interesting on the page or that sounded
interesting in his imagined pronunciations.

Cory the busboy offered up his find—he didn’t know how to read and
had  no  immediate plans to  learn. Elwood made his  bid.  Given the
personality of the kitchen, it was hard to think of anyone else who’d want
the encyclopedias. Then Pete, one of the new dishwashers, said he’d race
him for it.
Pete was a gawky Texan who’d started working two months prior. He
was hired to bus tables, but after a few incidents they moved him to the
kitchen. He looked over his shoulder when he worked, as if worried about
being watched, and didn’t talk much, although his gravelly laughter made
the other men in the kitchen direct their jokes toward him over time. Pete
wiped his  hands on  his  pants and  said, “We  got  time  before the  dinner
service, if you’re up for it.”
The kitchen made a proper contest of it. The biggest yet. A stopwatch
was produced and handed to Len, the gray-haired waiter who’d worked at
the hotel for more than twenty years. He was meticulous about his black
serving uniform, and maintained that he was always the best-dressed man in
the dining room, putting the white patrons to shame. With his attention to
detail, he’d make a dedicated referee. Two fifty-plate stacks were arranged,
after a proper soaking supervised by Elwood and Pete. Two busboys acted
as  seconds  for  this  duel, ready to  hand over  dry  replacement rags  when
requested. A lookout stood at the kitchen door in case a manager happened
by.
While not prone to bravado, Elwood had never lost a dish-drying contest
in four years, and wore his confidence on his face. Pete had a concentrated
air. Elwood didn’t perceive the Texan as a threat, having out-dried the man
in prior competitions. Pete was, in general, a good loser.
Len  counted down from ten,  and  they  began. Elwood stuck  to  the
method he’d perfected over the years, mechanistic and gentle. He’d never
let a wet plate slip or chipped one by setting it on the counter too quickly.
As the kitchen men cheered them on, Pete’s mounting stack of dried plates
unnerved Elwood. The Texan had an edge on him, displaying new reserves.
The onlookers made astonished noises. Elwood hurried, chasing after the
image of the encyclopedias in their front room.
Len said, “Stop!”

Elwood won by one plate. The men hollered and laughed and traded
glances whose meaning Elwood would interpret later.
Harold, one of the busboys, slapped Elwood on the back. “You were
made to wash dishes, slick.” The kitchen laughed.
Elwood returned volume Aa–Be to its box. It was a fancy reward.
“You earned it,” Pete said. “I hope you get a lot of use out of them.”
Elwood asked the housekeeping manager to tell his grandmother he was
going home. He couldn’t wait to see the look on her face when she saw the
encyclopedias on their bookshelves, elegant and distinguished. Hunched, he
dragged the boxes to the bus stop on Tennessee. To see him from across the
street—the serious young lad heaving his freight of the world’s knowledge
—was to  witness a  scene that  might have been illustrated by  Norman
Rockwell, if Elwood had had white skin.
At  home,  he  cleared Hardy Boys and  Tom  Swifts from the  green
bookcase in the front room and unpacked the boxes. He paused with Ga,
curious to see how the smart men at the Fisher company handled galaxy.
The  pages were blank—all of  them. Every volume in  the  first  box  was
blank except for the one he’d seen in the kitchen. He opened the other two
boxes, his face getting hot. All the books were empty.
When his grandmother came home, she shook her head and told him
maybe they  were defective, or  dummy copies the  salesman showed to
customers as samples, so they could see how a full set would look in their
homes. That night in  bed  his  thoughts ticked and  hummed like  a
contraption. It  occurred to  him  that  the  busboy,  that  all  the  men  in  the
kitchen had known the books were empty. That they had put on a show.
He  kept the  encyclopedias in  the  bookcase anyway.  They looked
impressive, even  when the  humidity peeled back the  covers. The  leather
was fake, too.
The next afternoon in the kitchen was his last. Everyone paid too much
attention to his face. Cory tested him with “How’d you like those books?”
and waited for a reaction. Over by the sink Pete had a smile that looked as if
it had been hacked into his jaw with a knife. They knew. His grandmother
agreed that he was old enough to stay in the house by himself. Through
high school, he  went back and  forth over the  matter of  whether the

dishwashers had let him win all along. He’d been so proud of his ability,
dumb and simple as it was. He never settled on one conclusion until he got
to Nickel, which made the truth of the contests unavoidable.

S
CHAPTER TWO
aying goodbye to the kitchen meant saying goodbye
to  his  separate game, the  one  he  kept private:
Whenever the dining-room door swung open, he bet
on  whether  there were Negro patrons out  there. According to Brown  v.
Board of Education, schools had to desegregate—it was only a matter of
time before  all  the  invisible walls came down. The  night the  radio
announced the  Supreme Court’s  ruling, his  grandmother shrieked as  if
someone had tossed hot soup in her lap. She caught herself and straightened
her dress. “Jim Crow ain’t going to just slink off,” she said. “His wicked
self.”
The morning after the decision, the sun rose and everything looked the
same. Elwood asked his  grandmother when Negroes were going to  start
staying at the Richmond, and she said it’s one thing to tell someone to do
what’s  right and  another thing for  them to  do  it.  She  listed some of  his
behavior as proof and Elwood nodded: Maybe so. Sooner or later, though,
the door would swing wide to reveal a brown face—a dapper businessman
in  Tallahassee for  business or  a  fancy lady  in  town to  see  the  sights—
enjoying the fine-smelling fare the cooks put out. He was sure of it. The
game began when he was nine, and three years later the only colored people
he  saw  in  the  dining room carried  plates or  drinks or  a  mop. He  never
stopped playing, up until his afternoons at the Richmond ended. Whether
his opponent in this game was his own foolishness or the mulish constancy
of the world was unclear.
Mr. Parker was not the only one who saw a worthy employee in Elwood.
White men were always extending offers of work to Elwood, recognizing
his industrious nature and steady character, or at least recognizing that he
carried himself differently than other colored boys his age and taking this

for industry. Mr. Marconi, the proprietor of the tobacco shop on Macomb
Street, had  watched Elwood since he  was  a  baby,  squealing in  a  noisy
carriage that was half rust. Elwood’s mother was a slim woman with dark,
tired eyes who never moved to quiet her child. She’d buy armfuls of movie
magazines and vanish into the street, Elwood howling all the way.
Mr. Marconi left his perch by the register as seldom as possible. Squat
and perspiring, with a low pompadour and a thin black mustache, he was
inevitably disheveled by evening. The atmosphere at the front of the store
was  stringent with his  hair  tonic and  he  left  an  aromatic trail  on  hot
afternoons. From his chair, Mr. Marconi observed Elwood grow older and
lean toward his own sun, veering away from the neighborhood boys, who
carried on and roughhoused in the aisles and slipped Red Hots into their
dungarees when they thought  Mr.  Marconi wasn’t  looking. He  saw
everything, said nothing.
Elwood belonged to the second generation of his Frenchtown customers.
Mr. Marconi hung out his shingle a few months after the army base opened
in ’42. Negro soldiers took the bus up from Camp Gordon Johnston or from
Dale Mabry Army Air Field, raised hell in Frenchtown all weekend, then
slumped back to  train for  war.  He  had  relatives who  opened businesses
downtown and  thrived, but  a  white man savvy to  the  economics of
segregation could turn a real buck. Marconi’s was a few doors down from
the Bluebell Hotel. The Tip Top Bar and Marybelle’s Pool Hall were around
the corner. He did a reliable trade in various tobaccos and tins of Romeos
prophylactics.
Once the  war  ended, he  moved  the  cigars to  the  back of  the  store,
repainted the walls white, and added magazine racks, penny candy, and a
soda cooler, which did much to improve the place’s reputation. He hired
help. He didn’t need an employee, but his wife liked telling people that he
had an employee, and he imagined it made the store more approachable to a
genteel segment of black Frenchtown.
Elwood was thirteen when Vincent, the tobacco shop’s longtime stock
boy,  signed up  for  the  army.  Vincent hadn’t  been the  most  attentive
employee, but  he  was  prompt  and  well-groomed, two  qualities that
Mr.  Marconi valued in  others if  not  in  himself. On  Vincent’s  last  day,
Elwood dawdled at the comics rack, as he did most afternoons. He had a

curious habit where he read every comic front to back before he bought it,
and he bought every one he touched. Mr. Marconi asked why go through all
that  if  he  was  going to  buy  them whether they  were good or  not,  and
Elwood said, “Just making sure.” The shopkeeper asked him if he needed a
job. Elwood closed the copy of Journey into Mystery and said he’d have to
ask his grandmother.
Harriet had a long list of rules for what was acceptable and what was
not, and sometimes the only way for Elwood to know how it all worked was
to make a mistake. He waited until after dinner, once they’d finished the
fried catfish and the sour greens and his grandmother rose to clear. In this
case, she held no hidden reservations, despite the fact that her uncle Abe
had  smoked  cigars and  look what happened to  him, despite Macomb
Street’s history as a laboratory of vice, and despite the fact she’d turned her
mistreatment by an Italian salesclerk decades ago into a cherished grudge.
“They’re probably not related,” she said, wiping her hands. “Or if they are,
distant cousins.”
She let Elwood work at the store after school and on weekends, taking
half his paycheck at the end of the week for the household and half for
college. He’d mentioned going to college the summer prior, casually, with
no  inkling of  the  momentousness of  his  words. Brown  v.  Board  of
Education  was  an  unlikely  turn, but  one  of  Harriet’s  family aspiring to
higher education was an actual miracle. Any misgivings over the tobacco
shop collapsed before such a notion.
Elwood tidied the newspapers and comic books in the wire racks, wiped
dust off the less popular sweets, and made sure that the cigar boxes were
arranged according to  Marconi’s  theories about packaging and  how it
excited “the  happy part  of  the  human brain.” He  still  hung around the
comics, reading them gingerly  as  if  handling dynamite, but  the  news
magazines exerted  a  gravity.  He  fell  under the  luxurious sway  of Life
magazine. A big white truck dropped off a stack of Life every Thursday—
Elwood came to learn the sound of its brakes. Once he sorted the returns
and displayed the new arrivals, he hunkered on the stepladder to follow the
magazine’s latest excursions into unreckoned corners of America.
He  knew  Frenchtown’s  piece  of  the  Negro’s  struggle, where his
neighborhood ended and white law took over. Life’s photo essays conveyed

him to the front lines, to bus boycotts in Baton Rouge, to counter sit-ins in
Greensboro, where young people  not  much older than  him  took  up  the
movement. They were beaten with metal bars, blasted by fire hoses, spat on
by white housewives with angry faces, and frozen by the camera in tableaus
of noble resistance. The tiny details were a wonder: how the young men’s
ties remained straight black arrows in the whirl of violence, how the curves
of the young women’s perfect hairdos floated against the squares of their
protest signs. Glamorous somehow, even when the blood flowed down their
faces. Young knights taking the  fight to  dragons. Elwood was  slight-
shouldered, skinny  as  a  pigeon,  and  he  worried about the  safety of  his
glasses, which were expensive  and  in  his  dreams broken in  two  by
nightsticks, tire irons, or baseball bats, but he wanted to enlist. He had no
choice.
Flipping pages during lulls. Elwood’s  shifts at  Marconi’s  provided
models for the man he wished to become and separated him from the type
of Frenchtown boy he was not. His grandmother had long steered him from
hanging out with the local kids, whom she regarded as shiftless, clambering
into  rambunction. The  tobacco  shop, like  the  hotel kitchen, was  a  safe
preserve. Harriet raised him strict, everyone knew, and the other parents on
their stretch of Brevard Street helped keep Elwood apart by holding him up
as an example. When the boys he used to play cowboys and Indians with
chased him down the street every once in a while or threw rocks at him, it
was less out of mischief than resentment.
People from his block stopped in Marconi’s all the time, and his worlds
overlapped. One afternoon, the  bell above the  door jangled and
Mrs. Thomas walked in.
“Hello, Mrs. Thomas,” Elwood  said. “There’s  some cold  orange in
there.”
“I think I just might, El,” she said. A connoisseur of the latest styles,
Mrs. Thomas was dressed this afternoon in a homemade yellow polka-dot
dress she’d copied from a magazine profile of Audrey Hepburn. She was
quite aware that few women in the neighborhood could have worn it with
such confidence, and  when she  stood still  it  was  hard to  escape the
suspicion that she was posing, waiting for the pop of flashbulbs.

Mrs. Thomas had been Evelyn Curtis’s best friend growing up. One of
Elwood’s earliest memories was of sitting on his mother’s lap on a hot day
while they played gin. He squirmed to see his mother’s cards and she told
him not to fuss, it was too hot out. When she got up to visit the outhouse,
Mrs. Thomas snuck him sips of her orange soda. His orange tongue gave
them away and  Evelyn half-heartedly scolded them while they  giggled.
Elwood kept that day close.
Mrs. Thomas opened her purse to pay for her two sodas and this week’s
Jet. “You keeping up with that schoolwork?”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“I don’t work the boy too hard,” Mr. Marconi said.
“Mmm,” Mrs. Thomas said. Her tone was suspect. Frenchtown ladies
remembered the tobacco store from its disreputable days and considered the
Italian an accomplice to domestic miseries. “You keep doing what you’re
supposed to, El.” She took her change and Elwood watched her leave. His
mother had left both of them; it was possible she sent her friend postcards
from this  or  that  place, even  if  she  forgot  to  write him. One day
Mrs. Thomas might share some news.
Mr. Marconi carried Jet, of course, and Ebony. Elwood got him to pick
up The Crisis and The Chicago Defender, and other black newspapers. His
grandmother and her friends subscribed, and he thought it strange that the
store didn’t sell them.
“You’re right,” Mr. Marconi said. He pinched his lip. “I think we used to
carry it. I don’t know what happened.”
“Great,” Elwood said.
Long after Mr.  Marconi had  stopped minding his  regulars’  buying
habits, Elwood remembered what brought each person into the store. His
predecessor,  Vincent, had  occasionally livened up  the  place with  a  dirty
joke, but it couldn’t be said that he had initiative. Elwood possessed it in
spades, reminding Mr. Marconi which tobacco vendor had shorted them on
the last delivery and which candy to quit restocking. Mr. Marconi struggled
to tell the colored ladies of Frenchtown apart—all of them wore a scowl
when they  saw  him—and Elwood made a  competent ambassador.  He’d
stare at the boy when he was lost in his magazines and try to figure what

made him  tick.  His  grandmother  was  firm, that  was  clear.  The  boy  was
intelligent and hardworking and a credit to his race. But Elwood could be
thick-witted when it came to the simplest things. He didn’t know when to
stand back and let things be. Like the business with the black eye.
Kids swiped candy,  it  didn’t  matter what color their skin was.
Mr. Marconi himself, in his untethered youth, had engineered all sorts of
foolishness. You  lose  a  percentage here  and  there, but  that  was  in  the
overhead—kids steal  a  candy bar  today but  they  and  their  friends spend
their money in the store for years. Them and their parents. Chase them out
into  the  street over  some little thing, word gets  around, especially in  a
neighborhood like  this  where everybody’s  in  everybody’s  business, and
then the parents stop coming in because they’re embarrassed. Letting the
kids steal was almost an investment, the way he looked at it.
Elwood drifted to a different perspective during his time in the store.
Before he worked at Marconi’s, his friends gloated over their candy heists,
cackling and  blowing insolent pink  bubbles of  Bazooka once they  got  a
good distance from  the  store. Elwood didn’t  join  in  but  he’d  never had
feelings on it. When Mr. Marconi hired him, his boss explained his attitude
toward sticky fingers, along with where they kept the mop and what days to
expect the big deliveries. Over the months, Elwood saw sweets disappear
into boys’ pockets. Boys he knew. Maybe with a wink to Elwood if they
caught his  eye.  For  a  year,  Elwood said  nothing. But  the  day  Larry and
Willie  grabbed the  lemon candies  when Mr.  Marconi bent behind the
counter, he couldn’t restrain himself.
“Put it back.”
The  boys stiffened. Larry and  Willie  had  known Elwood their whole
lives. Played marbles and tag with him when they were small, although that
ended when Larry started a fire in the vacant lot on Dade Street and Willie
got  left  back twice. Harriet struck them from the  list  of  allowable
companions. Their three families went back in Frenchtown for generations.
Larry’s grandmother was in a church group with Harriet, and Willie’s father
had been a childhood buddy of Elwood’s father, Percy. They shipped off to
the  army together.  Willie’s  father spent every day  on  his  porch in  his
wheelchair, smoking a pipe, and he waved whenever Elwood passed.
“Put it back,” Elwood said.

Mr. Marconi tilted his head: That’s enough. The boys returned the candy
and left the store, smoldering.
They knew Elwood’s route. Sometimes jeered at him for being a goody-
two-shoes when he biked past Larry’s window on his way home. That night
they  jumped him. It  was  just  getting dark and  the  smell of  magnolias
mingled with the tang of fried pork. They slammed him and his bike into
the new asphalt the county had laid down that winter. The boys tore his
sweater, threw his glasses into the street. As they beat him, Larry asked
Elwood if he had any damned sense; Willie declared that he needed to be
taught a lesson, and proceeded to do so. Elwood got a few licks in here and
there, not much to talk about. He didn’t cry. When he came upon two little
kids fighting on his block, Elwood was the kind to intervene and cool things
down. Now he was getting his. An old man from across the street broke it
up and asked Elwood if he wanted to clean himself or have a glass of water.
Elwood declined.
The chain on his bike was popped and he walked it home. Harriet didn’t
press him when she asked about his eye. He shook his head. By morning
the livid bump underneath was a bubble of blood.
Larry had a point, Elwood had to admit: From time to time it appeared
that he had no goddamned sense. He couldn’t explain it, even to himself,
until At Zion Hill gave him a language. We must believe in our souls that we
are somebody, that we are significant, that we are worthful, and we must
walk the streets of life every day with this sense of dignity and this sense of
somebody-ness. The record went around and around, like an argument that
always returned to its unassailable premise, and Dr. King’s words filled the
front room of the shotgun house. Elwood bent to a code—Dr. King gave
that code shape, articulation, and meaning. There are big forces that want to
keep the Negro down, like Jim Crow, and there are small forces that want to
keep you down, like other people, and in the face of all those things, the big
ones and the smaller ones, you have to stand up straight and maintain your
sense of who you are. The encyclopedias are empty. There are people who
trick you and deliver emptiness with a smile, while others rob you of your
self-respect. You need to remember who you are.
This  sense  of  dignity.  The  way  the  man  said  it,  crackle and  all:  an
inalienable strength. Even when consequences lay  in  wait  on  dark  street

corners on your way home. They beat him up and tore his clothes and didn’t
understand why he wanted to protect a white man. How to tell them that
their transgressions against Mr. Marconi were insults to Elwood himself,
whether it was a sucker candy or a comic book? Not because any attack on
his brother was an attack on himself, like they said in church, but because
for him to do nothing was to undermine his own dignity. No matter that
Mr. Marconi had told him he didn’t care, no matter that Elwood had never
said a word to his friends when they stole in his presence. It didn’t make no
sense until it made the only sense.
That was Elwood—as good as anyone. On the day he was arrested, just
before the deputy appeared, an advertisement for Fun Town came on the
radio. He hummed along. He remembered that Yolanda King was six years
old when her father told her the truth about the amusement park and the
white order that kept her outside the fence looking in. Always looking into
that other world. Elwood was six when his parents took off and he thought,
that’s another thing tying him to her, because that’s when he woke to the
world.
