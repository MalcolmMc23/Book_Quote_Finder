["1. \"Cora’s criticism did not extend to Typical Day’s wardrobe, which was made of coarse, authentic negro cloth.\"\n\n2. \"Some day, Miss Lucy told Cora one afternoon while they walked the green, all the numbers and figures and notes would make a great contribution to their understanding of colored life.\"\n\n3. \"The colored entrance was around the side but apart from that was identical to the white entrance, in the original design and not an afterthought, as was so often the case.\"\n\n4. \"The new hospital was specially equipped, and Dr. Stevens himself had studied under the man who pioneered the technique, which had been perfected on the colored inmates of a Boston asylum.\"\n\n5. \"The choice is yours, of course,” the doctor said. “As of this week, it is mandatory for some in the state. Colored women who have already birthed more than two children, in the name of population control. Imbeciles and the otherwise mentally unfit, for obvious reasons.

Managed other attitudes, such as sexual aggression and violent natures?\"\n\n12. \"With strategic sterilization—first the women but both sexes in time—we could free them from bondage without fear that they’d butcher us in our sleep.\"\n\n13. \"The data collected on the colored pilgrims and their descendants over years and decades, the doctor said, will prove one of the boldest scientific enterprises in history. Controlled sterilization, research into communicable diseases, the perfection of new surgical techniques on the socially unfit.\""]
